# Ruby Fitness
This was the first CodeClan project completed in week 5 after 4 weeks of learning OOP fundamentals and Ruby. It used Sinatra and RESTful routes. This particular project was chosen from a list of options and was to be a gym class booking system.

There are clear issues within this project - functions not meeting SOLID principles in particular - and the planning was not as good as it could be; it was forgotten until just before the due date that classes must be bookable every week, not just once.

However the project is pinned to show the improvment made from this project to the JavaScript Snakes and Ladders and Java Present Planner projects.
